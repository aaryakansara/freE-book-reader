# freE-book-reader
freE-book reader was designed for common people who would struggle to find a normal book-reading website that would include all they wanted in one place. 
It not only provides you a book, but also if you have something to contribute to the website, the user is most welcome to do so. 
It is free, itâ€™s easy to use and has easy access. 
Creating a free account lets you download all the books you need. 
Also by logging in you get to put your preferences and those category books will be at your service. 
Simply search a book and you can download it easily.
